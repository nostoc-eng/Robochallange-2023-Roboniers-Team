Hello!my name is Ahmed Elsayed a member of Roboniers and the one responsible for the programming portion of the robot ,this is a documentation of our project of a line follower robot in the Robochallange 2023 line follower category I have participated with 2 of my teammates Malek and Mariam each responsible for the mechanical and electrical portion of the robot respectively and our coaches Adham Mady and Allaa Mohamed we got third place and got nominated for the international competetion in China Beijing .

#The thought process that went into making our robot:

for the mechanical part of the robot that my teammate Malek was responsible for he decided that we want our robot design to be as simple as possible to avoid mechanical mistakes on the long run and thus we settled for a design with two wheels in the back and a caster wheel in the front 

here is a photo of the design:
